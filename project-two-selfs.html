    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 200%;"> <strong> My future self </strong> </h1>

    <p class="space" style="text-align: left;"> The being of my future self is a person who is what myself wants me in the future to be like, <br> 
        which is Jesus because he is our hope and the perfect image of my Father. <br> 
        The future self is loving, compassionate, merciful, lenient, and has a genuine and sincere heart. <span id="thelove">Even though</span> these things sound pleasant, it sounds like a pipe dream <br>
        compared to my current self, and to achieve them <span id="needs">requires help from everyone</span>. <br>
        The being of my future self is going to be a <span id="theaim">long goal</span> to <br>
        form myself to be a <span id="thegoal">life-long effort</span> to be more like the creator every day. <br>
        The being of my future self is nerve-racking <br>
        because of the anxiety about my future though the creator will make it clear as my life is in his hands. </p>

    <p class="space" style="text-align: right;"> The being of my future self looks like a normal person,  <br>
        though is outspoken and has a pure heart like God. He fears no one but God and is perfect <br>
        and turns many people to God. <br>
        he puts down his life for others and sells everything to help the poor around him <br>
        he focuses on prayer and the bible <br>
        he is clothed with humility, loves mercy, and acts justly <br>
        he is forgiving and inside has a loving heart. <br>
        The person is white as light, and is filled with love. <br>
        He humbly serves others in love. <br>
        He is free and uses his freedom to humbly serve others in love. <br>
        His favorite food is a burger because of it's savory taste. <br>
        His favorite color is red, because it's a color of healing and signifying sacrifice from Jesus Christ <br> 
        He is interested in others and their well-being. <br>
        His hair color is black and he dosen't always have a smile on his face <br>
        though his tone adjusts to the situation, for example if someone sins <br>
        he chastises them in love.
